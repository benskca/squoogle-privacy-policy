Squoogle is an Android game developed by Benedict Skinner Cassidy. The app has not been programmed to collect any personal data from the user. On startup the app creates a single file which is then used to store your progress in the game, and this can be deleted at any point by uninstalling the game. No additional files are created and the program accesses no other files stored on the users device. If you have any privacy concerns about the app please feel free to contact the developer at the details given below.
